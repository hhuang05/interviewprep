To run:
=======

1. Download IRTest.tgz into an empty directory

2. Unzip the file:

         tar -czf IRTest.tgz *

3. Compile (Tested on g++ 7.2):

        make

4. Run the file which generates some debug output and a set of final test result 

       ./IRTest

Assumptions:
=============

For this problem, I assume that there would be a front end which
parses the IR into the proper form as specified by my C++ class files.
